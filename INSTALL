Installing Pana

Please see README for more detail on requirements and optional features

In order to compile and install Pana on your system, type the following in the
base directory of the Pana distribution:


   % ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix` --disable-debug --disable-warnings
	# Assuming that works
   % make
   % make install

It's almost certain that you'll want to add features, run:

	% ./configure --help

to see the build options.
