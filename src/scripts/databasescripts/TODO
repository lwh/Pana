** TODO (databasescripts.rb) **

Script Ideas:
* Script to restore database backup
* Migration script (move directories)
* 1.4 -> 2.x converter - the one in 2.x does not work well

General:
* Properly use the ui file, to make it easier to maintain later
* Maybe pass error messages back to the parent dialog to abstract scripts away from pana?
